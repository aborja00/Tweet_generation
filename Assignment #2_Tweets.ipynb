      "ChatCompletionMessage(content=\"Once upon a time in the sun-kissed savannah, there lived a young zebra named Zuri. With her striking black and white stripes, she prided herself on being a part of the vibrant herd that roamed the plains. Zuri adored the thrill of galloping alongside her friends, but more than anything, she was curious about the world beyond their familiar grazing grounds.\\n\\nOne bright morning, while the herd was busy munching on sweet, green grass, Zuri's adventurous spirit tugged at her heart. She spotted a distant mountain range shimmering in the golden sunlight and decided to explore it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just sneak away for a short while,‚Äù she thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back before anyone notices!‚Äù\\n\\nWith a bounce in her step, Zuri set off, her heart racing with excitement. The vast landscape unfurled before her like a canvas, and as she trotted along, Zuri lost herself in the beauty of wildflowers and waving grasses. She galloped past babbling brooks and soaring acacia trees, becoming entranced by every new sight and sound.\\n\\nHours slipped by under the burning sun, and Zuri soon realized that she had wandered farther than she intended. The familiar sounds of her herd‚Äîthe low whinnies and gentle rustling of hooves‚Äîwere now just echoes in the distance. A chill of worry settled in her stomach as she looked around, realizing she was alone.\\n\\n‚ÄúI need to find my way back,‚Äù Zuri murmured, glancing nervously at the towering mountains that seemed so inviting moments before. With a determined huff, she tried retracing her steps, but every direction looked unfamiliar. The tall grass seemed to swallow her up, and the shadows of the setting sun loomed larger, deepening her sense of disorientation.\\n\\nAs night began to blanket the savannah, Zuri felt the weight of loneliness press upon her. She called out softly, ‚ÄúHerd! Where are you?‚Äù Her voice mingled with the night air, but only the rustle of leaves and the distant croaks of frogs replied.\\n\\nDesperate for comfort, Zuri recalled the stories her mother had shared about the nighttime constellations. Remembering that the North Star could guide her home, she gazed up at the sky, its tapestry of stars twinkling above. With a flicker of hope igniting within her, Zuri decided to follow the position of the North Star.\\n\\nAs she moved cautiously through the shadowy plains, she listened carefully, allowing her other senses to guide her. The sounds of the savannah came alive at night‚Äîcrickets chirping, the soft whispers of the wind, and the occasional call of distant animals. Each sound anchored her as she progressed, reminding her of the life that thrived around her.\\n\\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Zuri finally spotted the flicker of familiar shapes in the moonlight. Her heart leapt as she saw silhouettes herds of animals grazing in the distance‚Äîit was her family! She took off at a gallop, her hooves pounding against the earth, and soon she was greeted by the welcoming nuzzles and whinnies of her worried friends.\\n\\nZuri‚Äôs heart swelled with relief and joy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry for worrying you all!‚Äù she exclaimed, her voice ringing with sincerity. Her mother stepped forward, affectionately nuzzling her daughter‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúWe were so worried, but we‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre safe,‚Äù she replied softly.\\n\\nThat night, as the stars twinkled above, Zuri snuggled close to her herd, the warmth of companionship washing over her. She learned that while the world beyond her home was full of wonders, there‚Äôs no place like the safety of her family. From that day onward, she approached her curiosity with a new understanding‚Äîsometimes, the greatest adventures lie in the bonds we cherish. And so, Zuri continued to explore, but always with the comfort and strength of her herd beside her.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)\n"

    "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was one of several senior executives at the company under investigation by the Department of Justice when he was gunned down outside a Manhattan hotel on Wednesday. Thompson ‚Äî who was killed in what police called a targeted shooting outside the Hilton hotel in Midtown ‚Äî exercised stock options and sold shares worth $15.1 million on Feb. 16, less than two weeks before news of the federal antitrust probe went public, according to a Crain‚Äôs New York Business report from April.The stock price dropped sharply after the revelation that the DOJ was investigating whether the company had made acquisitions that consolidated its market position in violation of antitrust laws, a source familiar with the probe told the outlet.Thompson‚Äôs stock options reportedly had several years until expiration, and the sale of shares was his first since assuming the helm of parent company UnitedHealth‚Äôs insurance division in 2021.Thompson, 50, along with UnitedHealth Group chairman Stephen Helmsley, chief people officer Erin McSweeney and chief accounting officer Tom Roos, sold a combined $101.5 million in shares, with Helmsley personally netting just shy of $85 million, according to the report.Earlier this year, UnitedHealth was hit by one of the largest health care data breaches in US history, the company estimating that as many as one-third of Americans‚Äô private data ‚Äî potentially including Social Security numbers ‚Äî were compromised in the ransomware attack.The company wound up paying the hackers a $22 million ransom, CEO Andrew Witty told a congressional panel in May.\n",
